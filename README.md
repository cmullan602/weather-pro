## Description

- I created this project as part of my 6th challenge for coding bootcamp. For the project I started with nothing and was given the task of creating a website for the user to search for current weather and forecasted weather for any city. The application is meant to help the user look up current and forecasted weather. 

- In order to complete the project I accessed the Open Weather geocoding and direct API's. I used javascript and jquery to create dynamic elements that appear on the screen after entering the city. I also used moment.js to display all of the dates on the screen. 

- The project contians a working search form where you can enter a city. When the user enters a city the search is passed through the geocoding API. The longitute and latitude are returned form the geocode api then passed through the direct API which returns all of the weather data. The current weather and 5 day forecast are then displayed on the screen. When the current weather is displayed a UV index is included which will be green, yellow or red depending on the UV Index. Icons are displayed for the current weather and forecast to show the weather projections. 

- To use this application the user will enter a city name on the search bar and cilck search. 

- I found this project extremely rewarding once I got the weather data to display on the page. Working through the fetch functions to try and get the data I needed was very confusing and dificult. Also getting the icons to display to the screen was hard to figure out. After working through fetch and displaying to the screen adding the history to the screen and allowing the user to click was the hardest part for me. I'm not completely satisfied with the CSS but I wanted to get this submitted.
